The installed-images.json file format
--------------------------------

Each user is to have an `installed-images.json` file which holds a registry of installed docker images and some NON-USER-SET attributes about those images which are useful to subuser.  This is an autogenerated and non-user-editable file.  Do not edit it!

Each installed-programs.json file is to be a valid [json](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf) file containing a json object at the top level.

This object maps 
image ids to json objects which have the following attributes:

 * `last-update-time`: This is the `last-update-time` that was listed in the programs permissions.json file when the program was installed, or the last time the program was updated.

  Ex:

  ````json
   ,"last-update-time"                : "2014-02-12-12:59"
  ````

  **Note**: If the source program's `permissions.json` file listed no `last-update-time` this will be the actual clock time at which the program was installed.

 * `source-name`: This is the name of the program source from which this image was built.

  Ex:

  ````json
   ,"source-name"                        : "firefox"
  ````

 * `source-repo`: The name of the subuser repository from which the image was built.

  Ex:

  ````json
   ,"source-repo"                        : "default"
  ````
