The subusers.json file format
--------------------------------

Each user is to have an `subusers.json` file which holds a registry of subusers and some NON-USER-SET attributes about those subusers which are useful to subuser.  This is an autogenerated and non-user-editable file.  Do not edit it!

Each subusers.json file is to be a valid [json](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf) file containing a json object at the top level.

This object maps subuser names to json objects which have the following attributes:

 * `source-repo`: The identifier of the subuser repository where the source program on which this subuser is based resides.

  Ex:

  ````json
   ,"source-repo"                        : "default"
  ````

  type: See information about repository identifiers [here](repositories-dot-json-file-format.md).

 * `source-program`: The name of the source program on which this subuser is based.

  Ex:

  ````json
   ,"source-program"                        : "firefox"
  ````

  type: subuser names can be any unicode string not containing the symobol `@`
