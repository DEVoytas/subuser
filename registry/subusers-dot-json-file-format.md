The subusers.json file format
--------------------------------

Each user is to have an `subusers.json` file which holds a registry of subusers and some NON-USER-SET attributes about those subusers which are useful to subuser.  This is an autogenerated and non-user-editable file.  Do not edit it!

Each subusers.json file is to be a valid [json](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf) file containing a json object at the top level.

This object maps subuser names to json objects which have the following attributes:

 * `source-repo`: The identifier of the subuser repository where the source image on which this subuser is based resides.

  Ex:

  ````json
   ,"source-repo"                        : "default"
  ````

  type: See information about repository identifiers [here](repositories-dot-json-file-format.md).

 * `image-source`: The name of the image source on which this subuser's image is based.

  Ex:

  ````json
   ,"image-source"                        : "firefox"
  ````

  type: subuser names can be any unicode string not containing the symobol `@`

 * `docker-image`: The `Id` of the currently installed Docker image associated with this subuser.

  Ex:

  ````json
   ,"docker-image" : "21882137"
  ````

  type: A Docker image `Id`.

 * `executable-shortcut-installed`: Is an executable shortcut to be installed to the subuser bin directory?

  Ex:

  ````json
   ,"executable-shortcut-installed`:true
  ````

  type: boolean
