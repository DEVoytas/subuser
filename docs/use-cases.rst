Use cases
=========

Use ``subuser dev`` to build freecad more easily
------------------------------------------------

By using the command ``subuser dev freecad`` we enter a container which is pre-configured to compile and run freecad. This eliminates the constant struggle of trying to gather dependencies and compile freecad on the diverse linux systems that freecad's developers use.
