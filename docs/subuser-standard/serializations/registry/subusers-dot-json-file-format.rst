The subusers.json file format
--------------------------------

Each user is to have an ``subusers.json`` file which holds a registry of subusers and some NON-USER-SET attributes about those subusers which are useful to subuser.  This is an autogenerated and non-user-editable file.  Do not edit it!

Each subusers.json file is to be a valid `json <https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf>`_ file containing a json object at the top level.

This object maps subuser names to json objects which have the following attributes:

 * ``source-repo``: The identifier of the subuser repository where the source image on which this subuser is based resides.

  Ex::

    ,"source-repo"                        : "default"

  **type**: See information about repository identifiers `here <repositories-dot-json-file-format.md>`_ .

 * ``image-source``: The name of the image source on which this subuser's image is based.

  Ex::

    ,"image-source"                        : "firefox"

  **type**: subuser names can be any unicode string not containing the symobol ``@``

 * ``docker-image``: The ``Id`` of the currently installed Docker image associated with this subuser.

  Ex::

    ,"docker-image" : "21882137"

  **type**: A Docker image ``Id``.

 * ``executable-shortcut-installed``: Is an executable shortcut to be installed to the subuser bin directory in order to add the subuser to the $PATH?

  Ex::

    ,"executable-shortcut-installed" :true

  **type**: boolean

 * ``entrypoints-exposed``: Are there executable shortcuts installed for this subuser's entrypoints?

  Ex::

    ,"entrypoints-exposed" :true

  **type**: boolean

 * ``service-subusers``: List of service subusers that bellong to this subuser.

  Ex::

    ,"service-subusers" : ["!service-subuser-firefox-xpra-server","!service-subuser-firefox-xpra-client"]

  **type**: List of strings(subuser names).
