The installed-images.json file format
--------------------------------

Each user is to have an ``installed-images.json`` file which holds a registry of installed docker images and some NON-USER-SET attributes about those images which are useful to subuser.  This is an autogenerated and non-user-editable file.  Do not edit it!

Each installed-images.json file is to be a valid `json <http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf>`_ file containing a json object at the top level.

This object maps 
image ids to json objects which have the following attributes:

 * ``source-repo``: Id of the subuser repository from which the image was installed.

  Ex::

    "source-repo" : "default"

  Or if the repository is annonymous::

    "source-repo" : 1

 * ``source-image``: Name of the progam source from which this image was built.

  Ex::

    "source-image" : "firefox"

 * ``image-source-hash``: SHA-2 hash of the ``docker-image`` directory of the image source.

  Ex::

    "image-source-hash" : "51bcf28bcd4c01200ab7abd97d22a325e940fbd6"

Depricated:
-----------

 * ``last-update-time``: This is the ``last-update-time`` that was listed in the permissions.json file of the image source when the image was installed, or the last time the image was updated.

  Ex::

    ,"last-update-time"                : "2014-02-12-12:59"

  **Note**: If the source image's ``permissions.json`` file listed no ``last-update-time`` this will be the actual clock time at which the image was installed.
