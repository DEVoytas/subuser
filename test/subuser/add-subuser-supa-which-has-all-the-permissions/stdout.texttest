 Prelude:
  - description: A subuser with all permissions
  - maintainer: Timothy Hobbs <timothyhobbs@seznam.cz>
  - executable: /bin/bash
  - entrypoints: 'foo'
 Conservative permissions(These are safe):
  - basic-common-permissions: 
   * To have its own home directory where it can save files and settings.
  - memory-limit: Memory limited to 3g
  - max-cpus: CPUs limited to 3.5
 Moderate permissions(These are probably safe):
  - gui: To be able to display windows.
   * To be able to access the host's clipboard.
   * The border color will be yellow
  - user-dirs: To access to the following user directories: '~/Downloads'
  - inherit-envvars: To access to the following environment variables: GCC

  - webcam: To access your computer's webcam/can see you.
  - access-working-directory: To access the directory from which it was launched.
  - allow-network-access: To access the network/internet.
 Liberal permissions(These may pose a security risk):
  - system-dirs: To read and write to the host's `/var/log` directory, mounted in the container as:`/host/logs`

  - graphics-card: To access your graphics-card directly for OpenGL tasks.
  - serial-devices: To access serial devices such as programmable micro-controllers and modems.
  - system-dbus: To talk to the system dbus daemon.
  - sudo: To be allowed to use the sudo command to run subproccesses as root in the container.
  - as-root: To be allowed to run as root within the container.
 Anarchistic permissions
   WARNING: These permissions give the subuser full access to your system when run.
  - privileged: To have full access to your system.  To even do things as root outside of its container.
  - run-commands-on-host: To run commands as a normal user on the host system.
