  Remove images that are installed, but are not associated with any subusers.

  Tests
  -----

  **Setup:**

  >>> remove_old_images = __import__("subuser-remove-old-images")#import self
  >>> subuser = __import__("subuser-subuser")
  >>> import subuserlib.classes.user

  Check our assumptions about what subusers are installed in the test environment.  We load a new user object each time we checked, because we are interested about whether the changes we want are present on disk.

  >>> user = User()
  >>> subuserList = list(user.getRegistry().getSubusers().keys())
  >>> subuserList.sort()
  >>> for sb in subuserList:
  ...   print(sb)
  foo

  Add a ``bar`` subuser, which we will then remove.  This will leave us with a leftover image.

  >>> subuser.subuser(["add","--accept","bar","bar@file:///home/travis/remote-test-repo"])
  Adding subuser bar bar@file:///home/travis/remote-test-repo
  Adding new temporary repository file:///home/travis/remote-test-repo
  Verifying subuser configuration.

  Unregistering any non-existant installed images.

  Check to see if subuser ``bar`` was successfully added.

  >>> user = User()
  >>> subuserList = list(user.getRegistry().getSubusers().keys())
  >>> subuserList.sort()
  >>> for sb in subuserList:
  ...   print(sb)
  bar
  foo

  Check to see if the image for ``bar`` was also installed.

  >>> installedImages = list([i.getImageSourceName() for i in user.getInstalledImages().values()])
  >>> installedImages.sort()
  >>> for installedImage in installedImages:
  ...   print(installedImage)
  bar
  foo

  Remove the ``bar`` subuser.

  >>> subuser.subuser(["remove","bar"])
  Removing subuser bar
   If you wish to remove the subusers image, issue the command $ subuser remove-old-images
  Verifying subuser configuration.
  Verifying registry consistency...
  Unregistering any non-existant installed images.
  Running garbage collector on temporary repositories...

  See that the image for ``bar`` was indeed left behind.

  >>> user = User()
  >>> installedImages = list([i.getImageSourceName() for i in user.getInstalledImages().values()])
  >>> installedImages.sort()
  >>> for installedImage in installedImages:
  ...   print(installedImage)
  bar
  foo

  Use dry-run to see which images are to be deleted.

  >>> remove_old_images.removeOldImages(["--dry-run"])
  The following images are uneeded and would be deleted.
  DOCKER-ID : SUBUSER-ID
  Removing unneeded image 6 : bar@file:///home/travis/remote-test-repo

  Check to see that dry-run didn't actually remove the un-needed image.

  >>> user = User()
  >>> installedImages = list([i.getImageSourceName() for i in user.getInstalledImages().values()])
  >>> installedImages.sort()
  >>> for installedImage in installedImages:
  ...   print(installedImage)
  bar
  foo

  Add another subuser blah

  >>> subuser.subuser(["add","--accept","blah","blah@/home/travis/local-test-repo"])
  Adding subuser blah blah@/home/travis/local-test-repo
  Adding new temporary repository /home/travis/local-test-repo

  >>> installedImageList.sort()
  >>> for installedImage in installedImageList:
  ...   print(installedImage)
  bar
  blah
  foo

  Remove the ``blah`` subuser.

  >>> subuser.subuser(["remove","blah"])
  Removing subuser blah

  Now we use ``remove-old-images`` to remove images which belong to the local repository.

  >>> remove_old_images.removeOldImages(["--repo=/home/travis/local-test-repo"])
  Removing unneeded image 9 : blah@/home/travis/local-test-repo

  Now we use ``remove-old-images`` to clean up the rest of our un-needed installed images.

  >>> remove_old_images.removeOldImages([])

  And now the uneccesary ``bar`` image is gone.

  >>> user = User()
  >>> installedImages = list([i.getImageSourceName() for i in user.getInstalledImages().values()])
  >>> installedImages.sort()
  >>> for installedImage in installedImages:
  ...   print(installedImage)
